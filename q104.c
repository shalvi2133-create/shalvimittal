// Write a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1. Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.

int main() {
    int n;
    int leftSum, rightSum;

    printf("Enter value of n: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        leftSum = (x * (x + 1)) / 2;     
        rightSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2 - (x * (x - 1)) / 2;
